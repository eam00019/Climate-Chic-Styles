## Research Summary

**Websites Used:**
- [Foolproof Hairstyle to Withstand Rainy Weather](https://www.byrdie.com/rainy-day-hairstyles)
- [Easy Hairstyles That Will Stay Put on Windy Days](https://us.davines.com/blogs/news/easy-hairstyles-for-windy-days)
- [Hairstyle Adaptations for Weather Changes](https://dugrt.com/hairstyle-adaptations-for-weather-changes/#Winter_Haircare_Tips)

**Website Findings:**
- The URL is clear and direct, offering insight into both the page's content and its host website. The Base URL is  https://www.byrdie.com/.  This shows the domain and subdomain of the website.  The path is /rainy-day-hairstyles.  The path shows the location/route within the website’s directory structure.  The path ultimately helps identify specific content that the user is accessing.  This site lacks any query parameters (?), or fragment identifiers (#), which means that the content of the site is static and doesn't require additional data retrieval or page navigation within the same website. The Byrdie Website created a hamburger button on the header of the website, which I want to integrate into my website as well.   While inspecting I also thought it was interesting how many headers this website has.  I thought that a website would only contain one, but I was wrong.  I also could not pinpoint specific usages of bootstrap which leads me to believe that the website might be using a custom CSS or JavaScript for its styling and not bootstrap.
- The URL starts with the domain name us.davines.com and is followed by components that indicate the blog section /blogs/news/ and then the specific post is easy-hairstyles-for-windy-days. his site lacks any query parameters (?), or fragment identifiers (#), which means that the content of the site is static and doesn't require additional data retrieval or page navigation within the same website. The design of this website is clean and visually appealing.  It has high quality images that describe hairstyles, which I would like to implement into my website. The website is made using HTML.  I like how the website implements links to tutorials on how to do hairstyles.  I will implement hyperlinks into my website using the anchor feature (<a) like this example website did. I also liked how the website had an option for users to subscribe. I am not sure how far  I will get into building my website, but that would be a cool feature to add if I plan on actually developing it outside of class. It used <input type to ask users to add their emails.I also could not pinpoint specific usages of bootstrap which leads me to believe that the website might be JavaScript for its styling and not bootstrap.
- The URL has a base URL which is https://dugrt.com/hairstyle-adaptations-for-weather-changes/. This URL has a fragment identifier (#), which is #Haircare_for_All_Seasons.  The # helps navigate the user directly to the corresponding section where the anchor is located.  What drew my eye to this website was the table of contents.  I like how it helps redirect users to specific parts of the website.  I would like to include this in my website.  This website used HTML to make the table of contents.  It did it by using "li" which represents individual items in a list. I know that the website used a CSS stylesheet but I was not able to tell if it used bootstrap or not.  There was an ID used with the name ‘wcf__bootsrap_css-css.’  I am not sure if that was proof of bootstrap usage or not because it was misspelled.



## GitHub Repositories

**Repositories Used:**
- [Hair Salon Website Design using React.js](https://github.com/PappuKP/hair-salon-website-design-using-react.js)
- [ProjectSkinStore](https://github.com/stormyvikrant/ProjectSkinStore)

**Repository Findings:**
- The repository "hair-salon-website-design-using-react.js" is a project for designing a hair salon website using React.js. The README contains basic instructions on how to run the project locally, including installing dependencies and starting the development server. It also mentions the technologies used in the project, such as React, React Router, and Bootstrap. From the README, it seems like the project aims to provide a responsive and visually appealing website for a hair salon, utilizing modern web development technologies.  I will be taking inspo from this repo into my website.
- The "ProjectSkinStore" repository is for a website named SkinStore. The README gives an overview of the project, including its deployment link and how it adapts to different screen sizes. It lists the programming languages used, like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and explains the website's features, such as sorting products and managing a shopping cart. Additionally, it mentions technologies like React and contributions from various collaborators. In summary, the README provides a thorough summary of the SkinStore website clone, its features, and the tools used in its development.

## Future Enhancements

- Include interactive tutorials for different hairstyles.
- Add personalized pictures to enhance user experience.
- Implement feedback mechanisms like surveys, polls, or a blog board to foster a community.

## Reflection on Resources

Using W3Schools and ChatGPT proved to be helpful throughout the project. Although ChatGPT occasionally provided incorrect code, it was resolved with further exploration.
